üìå Project Name: JoeA


üí° Project Goal:

This project is to create a bot that answers users' questions on the Discord platform, using artificial intelligence. The bot works in any channel and returns answers according to the message written by the user.


üí°Deploying the bot to the server:

If you want to place the bot on any Discord server, open the html, css, js codes along with the python codes in the VS code program. (Jinja was used when writing the site codes. Therefore, after placing the codes in the VS code program, download Better Jinja from the Extensions section). Then, after writing cd in the terminal, write the path where the file is located. For example, "cd c:\Users\localadmin\Desktop\Discord_bot_projesi\DiscordAssistant". After writing this, write "python app.py". You should get a link like "http://192.168.100.11:5000" or something similar. After you paste this link into your browser, you should see the website I created. Click "Add to Discord". And now you can place the bot on the server you want to host.I am confident that I will enhance my skills and improve the quality of my project in the future.

OR

You can create a new bot by logging into the Discord developer portal. Follow the steps below:
1)Go to the Discord Developer Portal:
Link: https://discord.com/developers/applications
Log in with your Discord account.
2)Create a new application:
Click the ‚ÄúNew Application‚Äù button at the top right.
Give your application a name (e.g., ‚ÄúJoeA‚Äù) and click Create.
3)Create the bot:
In the left-hand menu, go to the ‚ÄúBot‚Äù tab.
Click ‚ÄúAdd Bot‚Äù, then confirm with ‚ÄúYes, do it!‚Äù.
You can change the bot's name and profile picture if you want
4)Get the token:
On the same page, find the ‚ÄúToken‚Äù section.
Click ‚ÄúReset Token‚Äù (if needed), then ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù to get your token.
You have created the Token. Now you need to copy this Token and paste it into the .env file.


üí°Activating the bot:

To activate the bot, open all python files in VS code. In the terminal, type cd (write the path to the code location). For example: c:\Users\localadmin\Desktop\Discord_bot_project\DiscordAssistant). Then, just type "python main.py".

üìÅ File Structure Explanation:

1)bot.py: Contains the main class of the Discord bot. The bot uses the discord.py library to communicate with the Discord Token. It processes commands, automatically modifies status messages, and sends greeting messages when connecting to servers.

2)commands.py: A large file containing all the commands of the bot. Commands include user registration, AI chat, weather information, calculator, news, translation, moderation commands (kick, ban, slowmode), and other functionalities.

3)ai_service.py: Communicates with the Google Gemini API and provides the AI ‚Äã‚Äãfunctionality of the bot. It has a caching system for queries and handles API requests.
